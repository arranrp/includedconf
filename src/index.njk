    <p>A new inclusive design conference</p> #}


<p>Included is a new lovingly-curated conference about inclusive design and accessibility in the digital world, the workplace and the built environment.</p>
<p>Throughout the day (and the evening), there will be a single track of authoritative experts talking about a diverse range of topics such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Making accessible mobile experiences</li>
<li>Ensuring digital access in lower-income countries</li>
<li>Roads and guide dogs</li>
<li>Cognitive accessibility</li>
<li>Queer history</li>
</ul>
<p>… and many more to be announced.</p>
<h2>When and where?</h2>
<p>6 October 2022, which makes it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(astrology)">Libra</a>, symbolised by the Scales of Justice held by Themis which became the inspiration for modern depictions of Lady Justice.</p><p>The venue is a modern, accessible location in London. All the daytime talks will be live-captioned.</p>
<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>Speakers will be announced on Twitter, our Discord server, and through our mailing list (sign up!). The event is organised and co-curated by Arran Ross-Paterson.</p>

<h2>Can my company sponsor?</h2>
<p>Well, that's very kind of you to offer. We'll certainly consider organisations that promote and demonstrate the values of accessibility and inclusivity. (So, if you're a big Evil Corp, arms manufacturer or a tobacco company, no.)</p>
<h2>Will talks be recorded and put on YouTube?</h2>
<p>No. To do it well would cost too much, and everyone's fed up of watching events on the web by now.</p>
