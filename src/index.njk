    <h2>When and where?</h2>
    <p>6 October 2022, which makes it a <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/horoscopes/a28887642/libra-traits/">Libra</a>, symbolised by the Scales of Justice held by the ancient Greek goddess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis">Themis</a>, which became the inspiration for modern depictions of Lady Justice.</p><p>The venue is a modern, accessible location in London. All the daytime talks will be live-captioned.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-start-2 col-span-4 bg-slate-300">

    <h2>Can my company sponsor?</h2>
    <p>Well, that's very kind of you to offer. We'll certainly consider organisations that promote and demonstrate the values of accessibility and inclusivity. (So, if you're Vladimir Putin, a big Evil Corp, arms manufacturer or a tobacco company, no.)</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-start-2 col-span-4 bg-slate-300">
    <h2>Will talks be recorded and put on YouTube?</h2>
    <p>No. To do it well would cost too much, and everyone's fed up of watching events on the web by now.</p>
